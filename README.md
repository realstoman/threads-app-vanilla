# Threads App - Vanilla CSS/Sass

This is a simple project where I designed the important parts of the newly launched app Threads by Meta. It's coded using CSS/Sass. This version of the Threads App project is just the UI. For a more dynamic one, please visit the [Thread App React/Next.js](https://github.com/realstoman/threads-app-vanilla) version.
